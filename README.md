This was my final training project for my iOS development training at ISU ITS (They own it because of that - just here for street cred). It was pretty open-ended, the only requirements for it were to use Realm and one or two other CocoaPods used in the main project. I decided to do a web browser because I thought it would be pretty neat. Overall Iâ€™m pretty proud of how it turned out. This was a solo project done in Swift.
