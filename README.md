# iOS-browser
a cool web browser for iOS devices

this was my final training project for my iOS dev training at ISU ITS - they technically own it i think, just posting it here for street cred
(version history is messed up cuz I didn't have a proper .gitignore set up initially and just pushed the whole pods directory like a total loser. github doesn't like that since it's full of big files, so i had to remove the version history since it included that stuff)
